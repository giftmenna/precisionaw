To get Bolt.new to rebuild your app effectively, you need to provide a clear, concise, and detailed description of your web application—Precision Academic World—so the AI can understand its purpose, structure, and functionality. Bolt.new works best when you specify the app's goals, key features, tech stack, and any specific design or behavior preferences. Since I’ve already analyzed your app based on your earlier input, I’ll guide you on how to craft a prompt that communicates this to Bolt.new accurately. Below is a step-by-step approach to describing your app, followed by a sample prompt tailored for Bolt.new.

### How to Describe Your App to Bolt.new
1. **State the Purpose**: Start with a high-level overview of what your app does and who it’s for. This sets the context.
2. **Specify Key Features**: List the main functionalities (e.g., public homepage, practice tests, dashboard) and how they work.
3. **Define the Structure**: Mention the main pages or components and their purposes (e.g., `Home`, `Test`, `Dashboard`).
4. **Mention Authentication**: Explain which parts are public and which require login, including the auth flow.
5. **Include Tech Stack**: Bolt.new can scaffold your app with specific tools—tell it to use React, Firebase, etc., if that’s what you want.
6. **Describe Styling**: Note any design preferences (e.g., light/dark mode, responsive layout).
7. **Add Specific Behaviors**: Highlight unique features like timers in tests or saving results to a database.
8. **Keep It Concise**: Bolt.new processes text as tokens, so be detailed but avoid unnecessary fluff.

### Sample Prompt for Bolt.new
Here’s a prompt you can use or adapt. It’s based on your app’s current state and goals, assuming you want to rebuild it with similar functionality:

---

"Build a web app called Precision Academic World, an educational platform to empower young learners. It’s for students and educators, offering academic resources and practice tests. Use React with TypeScript for the frontend, Firebase for authentication and Firestore for data storage, and CSS with light/dark mode theming (use CSS variables). Make it responsive for mobile and desktop.

The app has two main sections:  
1. **Public Area**: A homepage (`/`) accessible without login, featuring a header with a mission statement ('Creating a better future for every young person'), a photo gallery, a word of the day, and a leaderboard showing top scores (anonymized, e.g., 'Student A - 95%'). Include static pages like About (`/about`), Terms (`/terms`), and Privacy (`/privacy`) linked in a footer.  
2. **Authenticated Area**: Requires login/signup. Include:  
   - **Login (`/login`)** and **Signup (`/signup`)** pages using Firebase email/password auth, with a forgot password option (`/forgot-password`).  
   - **Dashboard (`/dashboard`)** showing user stats (e.g., total test time, average score) with a chart.  
   - **Test (`/test`)** page for practice tests in English and Math, with a timer and multiple-choice questions. Save results to Firestore and redirect to a **Results (`/results`)** page showing score and answers.  
   - **Grades (`/grades`)** page listing past test scores from Firestore.  
   - **Profile (`/profile`)** showing user info (e.g., name, email).  

Add navigation: a header with links to Home, Dashboard, Profile, and Logout (authenticated users only). Protect authenticated routes—redirect to `/login` if not signed in. For the Test page, include a sample question set (e.g., 5 questions per subject) and a 'Submit' button to end the test. Deploy it with a clean, modern UI."

### Tips for Using This Prompt
- **Paste into Bolt.new**: Copy this directly into Bolt.new’s input field and hit submit. It’ll generate a starting point you can refine.
- **Refine with Follow-Ups**: If something’s missing (e.g., competition features), add a follow-up prompt like: "Add a Competitions page (`/competitions`) listing upcoming events from Firestore, marked as 'COMING SOON!' for now."
- **Check Tech Stack**: If you want a different stack (e.g., Next.js instead of plain React), tweak the prompt accordingly.
- **Enhance Prompt**: Before submitting, click Bolt.new’s "enhance" icon to let the AI refine your wording, then review it.
- **Edit Generated Code**: Bolt.new might not get everything perfect (e.g., placeholder images might break). Use its in-browser editor to fix issues.

### Why This Works
This prompt covers your app’s core identity (educational platform), its dual nature (public and authenticated), and technical details (React, Firebase). It’s specific enough to guide Bolt.new but leaves room for the AI to fill in gaps (e.g., sample questions, styling). Since Bolt.new runs full-stack apps in the browser with WebContainers, it’ll scaffold routing, Firebase integration, and a deployable app you can tweak.

If you want to adjust this further—like adding guest mode or premium features—or need help with a specific follow-up prompt, let me know! What do you think—does this capture your vision for Precision Academic World?
